# Emulate_do-while-in-Python

We know that there is no do while loop in python. Though we can emulate do while loop in python.

In do while loop , loop will be executed at least once irrespective of whether condition is True or Not
And then the next iteration will be executed only if the condition is "True"

So how can we emulate do while loop in Python?

By using a infinite while loop, and using the logic above mentioned, we can emulate it.
The following py code will show how to emulate do while loop
